# Task : Let's say you left a message before that prints a password you need. To see the password you left, you need to enter your name and the program should recognize you.
# Write a program that 

# Takes the first name from the user and compares it to yours,
# Then if the name the user entered is the same as yours, print out such as : "Hello, Joseph! The password is : @12",
# If the name the user entered is not the same as yours, print out such as : "Hello, Amina! See you later."
# Write your Python codes on any IDLE, push it up to your GitHub repository and submit your GitHub Page link address in addition to your code as a plain text.
